Anomaly detection is an important part of machine learning that makes the results
unbiased to any category or class. While in time series modelling it takes a very
important place because there is a variety of anomalies that can be there in time-series
data. Elaborating what we have done, we have applied four different unsupervised
models which are (“SVM”, “PCA”, “KNN”, “DBSCAN”).
the least accuracy was the KNN’s accuracy as it was 90%, and the remaining models
(“SVM”, “PCA”, “DBSCAN”) their accuracy were equally 93%.
We have visualized our results by using 2D and 3D TSNE, and classification report for
each model
